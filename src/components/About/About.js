             A customer relationship management (CRM) system collects, organizes, and maintains all of your customer-related data so you can monitor the buyer's journey for each individual you deal with, improve communication, and better manage data.

CRM software is one of the most essential sales tools in a sales representative's armory since it helps them to spend more time with customers, and the more time spent with customers, the more transactions are done and the more loyal customers remain.

The main goal of this project is to learn how to use Spring MVC to create a web-based  CRM application. You will learn how to use CRUD operations, MVC design pattern, and Object-relational mapping framework after completing the project. By that time, you'll have a good understanding of HTML and CSS as they are used for frontend.

<h3>Skills to gain from this project</h3>
This project involves the development of a backend online application that allows us to generate, read, update, and delete (CRUD) client information. Following frameworks and technologies will be used to create this interesting CRUD application:

Spring Framework:  For sophisticated Java-based corporate applications, it provides a complete programming and configuration paradigm.
Hibernate (ORM framework): A Java framework that makes it easier to create Java applications that interface with databases.
JDBC: The JDBC API is a set of Java interfaces and classes that allow Java programs to interact with database management systems.
Maven: A Java-based project development and management tool. It can control the construction, reporting, and documentation of a project from a single location.
JSP: Allows you to create dynamic, data-driven pages for Java web applications built on the Java Servlet standard.
MySQL: A relational database management system (RDBMS) created by Oracle that is based on structured query language (SQL).
This project will teach you how to create great scalable web apps mostly utilizing spring core. These abilities will come in as you begin developing applications ranging from desktop to web-based. Learning these will be an added benefit and a plus when collaborating with a different tech stack to develop real scalable web apps such as streaming TV, collaboration and management tools, and so on.

<h3>Who should try this project</h3>
Prerequisites
To complete this project, you will need a basic understanding of key Java principles as well as basic HTML and CSS. Knowledge of the spring framework will be really beneficial. However, these will undoubtedly be learned during the process of performing this project.

Time required
This project is projected to take between 75 and 80 hours to complete.

Difficulty level
It is ideal for Java and web development developers with good hands-on experience since it allows them to create code in core Java, begin using powerful Java frameworks, and learn to construct strong scalable applications. It is not a suitable place to start for beginners since they will struggle to learn too many things at once in order to complete this project.
